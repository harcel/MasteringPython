# MasteringPython
This is the material for a one-day course with some practical, somewhat advanced Python tricks to write pythonic, optimized code. 
It is created to be shown as a Rise.js slide show, so in notebook format, not all cells look as nice as they should.
The list of topics is as follows:
- The python object/data model
- Optimizing code with numpy
- Iterators and generators
- Decorators
- Object oriented programming and classes
- Class inheritance for practical use cases

Note that a whole lot of important topics is left out!
